    <h1 class="sub_section">Post Mortem</h1>
    <p>
      In this project, we have successfully completed the heavy lifting of
      graphics in C++, as well as an engine UI for editing. We have integrated
      box2d physics into our game (which can be our "WOW" factor) and also audio
      with SDL Mixer in C++. We have some singletons such as the resource
      manager for resource controls. We have build a rather complex editor UI in
      python using Tkinter to draw different frames and canvas on a window
      (perhaps another "WOW" factor?).
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the biggest regrets for us is that we didn't have the time to put
      everything together at the end. The reason is that the scope we set for
      our project exceeds what we can actually complete in about a month time.
      If we are given one or two additional weeks, we believe that we can take
      this project next level.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of the complexity comes from the UI controller which expects more
      work and functions than what we need. But it indeed provides potential for
      a more advanced engine in the future. It could be a good objective for us
      to finish implementing functions for construction of a game or a level
      using data-oriented design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing we could do is to complete collision check in box2d physics
      world; we can add winning and losing conditions on top of it. Some
      monsters with AI component controlling movements will also be possible.
    </p>
    <p class="end">
      In summary, we have worked hard, learned a lot, and had fun throughout the
      last couple of week. All teammembers dedicated about 5 hrs per DAY on the
      project. Although there's a few regrets, we have come to a final product
      that everyone is extremely proud of.
